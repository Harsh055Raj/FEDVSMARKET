Federal Funds Rate , the rate at which banks borrows from and lend to each other overnight -has a strong effect across the entire U.S economy including the US stock market as assumed by the existing models and the analysists working on it.

As per the basic economic model Higher Interest rate trend to negatively affect the earnings and the stock price , higher interest rate also means future discounted valuation are lower as the discount rate used for future cash flow is higher.
